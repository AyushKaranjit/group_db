    <h1>Video Demonstration Script Outline</h1>

    <h2>Introduction (About 45 seconds)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> Good afternoon everyone. We are Group 1, with
      Nabin Thapaliya, Anuskar Sigdel, Ayush Karanjit, and myself, Utsab Thami
      Magar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> For this assignment, we needed to design and build
      a database based on the ER Diagram we were given. Our job was to create
      SQL scripts that would build the database structure, make sure the data
      stays correct, add sample data, and show how to get useful information
      from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> Today we will show you what we did and how each
      part works. Nabin will start by explaining how we set up the database
      tables.
    </p>

    <h2>Creates Script (About 1 minute)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Nabin:</strong> Thank you, Utsab. I worked on the scripts that
      create and remove the database tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nabin:</strong> First, I made the
      <code>creates_group1.sql</code> file. <em>(briefly shows script)</em> This
      script creates all the tables we need like <code>students</code>,
      <code>modules</code>, <code>degrees</code>, and others based on our ER
      Diagram. It sets up each table with the right column names and data types
      - using <code>NUMBER</code> for IDs, <code>VARCHAR2</code> for text, and
      <code>DATE</code> for dates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nabin:</strong> Now Ayush will explain how we made sure the data
      stays correct with constraints.
    </p>

    <h2>Constraints Script (About 2 minutes)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ayush:</strong> Thank you, Nabin. After setting up the tables, we
      needed to add rules to make sure the data stays correct. We did this with
      the <code>constraints_group1.sql</code> script.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>(shows script)</em> This script adds rules that the database will
      follow at all times.
    </p>
    <p>We added several types of rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Primary Keys</strong> for each table to make sure every record
        can be found easily. For example, each student has a unique
        <code>student_id</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Foreign Keys</strong> to connect tables together. These make
        sure that when a student is linked to a degree program, that degree must
        exist in the <code>degrees</code> table.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Check constraints</strong> to limit what values can go in
        certain columns. For instance, the <code>grade</code> column can only
        have proper letter grades.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Not Null constraints</strong> for important information that
        must be filled in. Things like a student's first name cannot be left
        empty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unique constraints</strong> for information that shouldn't be
        repeated, like assignment codes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Default values</strong> for when information isn't provided. For
        example, attendance date will use today's date if none is given.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Ayush:</strong> These rules work together to keep our data
      accurate and reliable. Now Utsab will explain how we added sample data to
      our tables.
    </p>

    <h2>Insert Script (About 1.5 minutes)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> Thank you, Ayush. After setting up the tables and
      rules, we needed to add sample data to the database using the
      <code>inserts_group1.sql</code> script.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>(shows script)</em> This script contains
      <code>INSERT INTO</code> statements for each table in our database. The
      assignment asked for at least five records per table, but we added extra
      in some tables to make our query examples better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> We used realistic test data with proper names,
      addresses, grades, and course codes. Using realistic data helps us test
      how the database would work in a real school setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> We made sure to format dates correctly as the
      assignment required. We used the format <code>DATE '2023-09-15'</code> for
      all date information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> We also used a different way to add data i.e to
      specify just certain columns, like the ID and name for a marker. This lets
      the database handle the other columns, using defaults or leaving them
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> We also demonstrated inserting data while relying
      on default constraints. For example, when adding an attendance record, we
      did not specify the attendance date. Because we set up a default value for
      that column, the database automatically used the current system date
      (SYSDATE) for the record.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> The main challenge was keeping all relationships
      between tables correct. When adding a student enrollment, we had to make
      sure both the student and the module existed in their tables first.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> I'll now hand over to Anuskar, who will show how
      we get useful information from our database.
    </p>

    <h2>Queries Script (About 2 minutes)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Anuskar:</strong> Thank you, Utsab. Now I'll show how we can get
      useful information from our database using the
      <code>queries_group1.sql</code> script.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>(shows script)</em> This script shows different ways to get
      information using SQL. Here are the main types of queries we made:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Simple Select queries</strong> that get all data from one table.
        For example, <code>SELECT * FROM students;</code> shows all student
        records.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Projection queries</strong> that get only certain columns. This
        is useful when you only need specific information, like student names
        and phone numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Filter queries</strong> that use the <code>WHERE</code> clause
        to find specific records. For example, finding students who live in a
        certain city or assignments due this month.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Join queries</strong> that combine information from multiple
        tables. These show connections like which students are taking which
        modules, or which modules are part of each degree program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advanced queries</strong> using functions like
        <code>COUNT</code>, <code>AVG</code>, and grouping with
        <code>GROUP BY</code>. These help answer questions like how many
        students are in each module or what the average grade is.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Anuskar:</strong> These queries show how our database can answer
      practical questions that school staff might need to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Anuskar:</strong> Now Nabin will explain the cleanup script we
      created.
    </p>

    <h2>Drops Script (About 30 seconds)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Nabin:</strong> I also made a cleanup script called
      <code>drops_group1.sql</code>. <em>(shows script)</em> This script helps
      us restart the database when needed during testing. It removes all
      constraints first, then removes all tables, and finally cleans up the
      recyclebin. This gives us a clean start each time we run our scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nabin:</strong> The order is important - we must remove the
      constraints before the tables to avoid errors. This keeps everything
      working smoothly when we rebuild the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nabin:</strong> Finally, Utsab will explain how we put everything
      together with the master run script.
    </p>

    <h2>Master Run Script (About 1 minute)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> To make testing our database easy, we created a
      main script called <code>run_group1.sql</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>(shows script)</em> This script runs all our other scripts in the
      right order. It first cleans everything with the
      <code>drops</code> script, then creates the tables, adds the rules,
      inserts the data, and finally runs the queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> This approach makes it simple to test the whole
      database with just one command. You don't need to know which script to run
      first - the master script handles everything in the correct order.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> It also helped us during development. When we
      changed one script, we could run the master script to make sure everything
      still worked together properly.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion (About 30 seconds)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> To sum up, our team successfully built a database
      system based on the ER Diagram we were given. We created scripts to set up
      the tables, add rules to keep the data correct, fill the database with
      sample data, and show how to get useful information from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utsab:</strong> Each team member worked on different parts, but we
      worked together to make sure everything fit properly. The result is a
      complete database system that meets all the assignment requirements.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Utsab:</strong> Thank you for listening to our presentation.</p>

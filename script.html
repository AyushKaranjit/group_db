    <h1>Video Script Outline (Total Time: ~10 minutes)</h1>

    <h2><span class="timestamp">(0:00 - 1:00)</span> Introduction (Anuskar)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "Hello everyone. We are Group 1, consisting
      of Nabin Thapaliya, Ayush Karanjit, Utsab Thami Magar, and myself, Anuskar
      Sigdel. For this assignment, we designed and implemented a relational
      database based on the provided Entity Relationship Diagram."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "Our goal was to create a functional database
      schema in Oracle SQL, ensuring data integrity through various constraints,
      populate it with sample data, and demonstrate how to retrieve information
      using SQL queries."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "We divided the core database tasks among the
      group members. Nabin focused on creating the tables and the drop script,
      Ayush handled the constraints, Utsab populated the database with initial
      data, and I developed the queries. Let's start with Nabin explaining the
      table creation process."
    </p>

    <h2>
      <span class="timestamp">(1:00 - 3:30)</span> Database Design & Table
      Creation (Nabin)
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>(Nabin):</strong> "Thanks, Anuskar. My first task was to
      translate the ERD, shown in the assignment specifications, into logical
      table structures."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Nabin):</strong> "This involved defining each table, its columns,
      and appropriate datatypes. We aimed for clarity and consistency in naming
      conventions."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Nabin):</strong>
      <em>(Show/Scroll through <code>creates_group1.txt</code> from nabin.html)</em>
      "This is the <code>creates_group1.txt</code> script. It contains the
      <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements for all the entities identified in
      the design phase, such as <code>degrees</code>, <code>students</code>,
      <code>modules</code>, <code>assignments</code>, <code>submissions</code>,
      and the junction tables like <code>degree_modules</code> and
      <code>student_submissions</code> needed for many-to-many relationships."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Nabin):</strong> "For example, here's the
      <code>students</code> table definition, specifying columns like
      <code>student_id</code>, <code>degree_id</code>, names, date of birth,
      and contact details with their respective datatypes like
      <code>NUMBER</code>, <code>VARCHAR2</code>, and <code>DATE</code>."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Nabin):</strong> "We also created a corresponding
      <code>drops_group1.txt</code> script."
      <em>(Briefly show <code>drops_group1.txt</code> from nabin.html)</em>
      "This script is essential for cleaning up the database. It drops all
      constraints first, then the tables, and finally purges the recycle bin,
      ensuring a clean state for re-running our creation scripts. Now, Ayush
      will explain how we enforced data integrity using constraints."
    </p>

    <h2>
      <span class="timestamp">(3:30 - 6:00)</span> Constraints & Integrity
      (Ayush)
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>(Ayush):</strong> "Thank you, Nabin. Once the tables were
      defined, my focus was on implementing constraints to ensure database
      integrity, which is crucial for maintaining data accuracy and consistency.
      We focused on three main types: Entity, Referential, and Domain
      Integrity."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Ayush):</strong>
      <em>(Show/Scroll through <code>constraints_group1.txt</code> from ayush.html)</em>
      "This <code>constraints_group1.txt</code> script uses
      <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statements to add these constraints after the
      tables are created."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Ayush):</strong> "For Entity Integrity, we defined Primary Keys
      for each table, like <code>pk_students</code> on
      <code>students(student_id)</code>. This ensures every student has a
      unique ID and no record is duplicated."
      <em>(Point to relevant PK constraint)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Ayush):</strong> "For Referential Integrity, we used Foreign Keys
      to link related tables. For instance, <code>fk_students_degrees</code>
      links the <code>degree_id</code> in the <code>students</code> table to
      the <code>degree_id</code> in the <code>degrees</code> table."
      <em>(Point to relevant FK constraint)</em> "This prevents us from
      assigning a student to a non-existent degree or deleting a degree that
      still has students assigned to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Ayush):</strong> "For Domain Integrity, we used several
      constraint types:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>NOT NULL</code> constraints, like on
          <code>student_fname</code>, ensure essential information isn't
          missing." <em>(Point to a NOT NULL constraint)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>CHECK</code> constraints validate data values. For example,
          <code>check_grade</code> on <code>student_submissions</code> ensures
          grades are within the allowed set ('A+', 'A', etc.), and
          <code>check_module_status</code> ensures the status is 'Y' or 'N'."
          <em>(Point to CHECK constraints)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>UNIQUE</code> constraints, like
          <code>unique_assignment_code</code> on <code>assignments</code>,
          prevent duplicate assignment codes."
          <em>(Point to a UNIQUE constraint)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>DEFAULT</code> constraints provide default values, like setting
          the <code>attendance_date</code> in the <code>attendances</code> table
          to <code>SYSDATE</code> if not specified."
          <em>(Point to a DEFAULT constraint)</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Ayush):</strong> "These constraints work together to keep the
      database reliable. Next, Utsab will show how we populated these tables
      with data."
    </p>

    <h2>
      <span class="timestamp">(6:00 - 8:00)</span> Data Insertion (Utsab)
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>(Utsab):</strong> "Thanks, Ayush. With the structure and rules in
      place, the next step was to insert sample data using the
      <code>inserts_group1.txt</code> script."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Utsab):</strong>
      <em>(Show/Scroll through <code>inserts_group1.txt</code> from utsab.html)</em>
      "This script contains <code>INSERT INTO</code> statements for each table.
      We added at least five records per table as required, ensuring the data
      covers various scenarios for testing."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Utsab):</strong> "For example, here we are inserting data into
      the <code>degrees</code> table, providing values for
      <code>degree_id</code>, title, detail, level, and year."
      <em>(Point to degrees inserts)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Utsab):</strong> "Similarly, we added records for examiners,
      markers, students, modules, and linked them through the junction tables
      like <code>degree_modules</code> and <code>module_lists</code>."
      <em>(Point to examples in other tables)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Utsab):</strong> "A key point here is the handling of dates. As
      per the requirements, we avoided using <code>TO_DATE</code> and instead
      used ANSI DATE literals like <code>DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD'</code> for inserting
      dates, for example, in the <code>students</code> table for the
      <code>dob</code> column." <em>(Point to a DATE literal example)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Utsab):</strong> "Having this sample data is vital for verifying
      that the constraints work correctly and for testing the queries, which
      Anuskar will demonstrate now."
    </p>

    <h2>
      <span class="timestamp">(8:00 - 9:45)</span> Querying the Database
      (Anuskar)
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "Thank you, Utsab. Finally, to retrieve
      information and demonstrate the database's utility, I developed the
      <code>queries_group1.txt</code> script."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong>
      <em>(Show/Scroll through <code>queries_group1.txt</code> from anuskar.html)</em>
      "This script includes various types of queries as required by the
      assignment."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "We start with simple queries, like
      <code>SELECT * FROM students;</code> to retrieve all records from the
      <code>students</code> table."
      <em>(Show and potentially run the query)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "We also have projection queries selecting
      specific columns, like
      <code
        >SELECT student_fname, student_lname, address FROM students ORDER BY
        student_lname DESC;</code
      >, which also demonstrates sorting." <em>(Show/run query)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "Restriction queries use the
      <code>WHERE</code> clause. For example, finding students from 'Kathmandu'
      (<code>WHERE address = 'Kathmandu'</code>) or using logical operators like
      finding students from 'Kathmandu' <code>AND</code> born after a certain
      date." <em>(Show/run examples)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "More complex queries involve joining tables.
      Here's a 2-table join showing students and their degree titles by joining
      <code>students</code> and <code>degrees</code> on
      <code>degree_id</code>." <em>(Show/run 2-table join)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "And here's a 3-table join showing students,
      their enrolled modules, and the examiner for that module by joining
      <code>students</code>, <code>module_lists</code>, <code>modules</code>,
      and <code>examiners</code>." <em>(Show/run 3-table join)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "We also included queries using aggregate
      functions, like this one counting the number of submissions per module
      using <code>COUNT</code> and <code>GROUP BY</code>."
      <em>(Show/run aggregate query)</em> "These queries demonstrate how we can
      extract meaningful, summarized information from the related tables."
    </p>

    <h2><span class="timestamp">(9:45 - 10:00)</span> Conclusion (Anuskar)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "So, to summarize, our group successfully
      designed the database schema from the ERD, created the tables, enforced
      entity, referential, and domain integrity using various constraints,
      populated the tables with sample data, and wrote queries to retrieve
      useful information. We've demonstrated the creation and querying process
      through our SQL scripts."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(Anuskar):</strong> "This concludes our demonstration. Thank you
      for watching."
